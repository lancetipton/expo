### üõ† Breaking changes

- Removed support for fetching notifications-related permissions (they have been moved to `expo-notifications` package). You no longer will be able to call `getAsync` or `askAsync` with `.NOTIFICATIONS` or `.USER_FACING_NOTIFICATIONS` without having `expo-notifications` package installed.
